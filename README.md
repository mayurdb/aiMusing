Musing over AI

- large_language_hashmap.ipynb -> Trying to understand if LLM approximates a high dimensional hash map lookup
- is_llm_thinking_in_english.ipynb -> Checking the tokens of the hidden layers of LLM for Tamil to Hindi language translation. The model seems to first translate the contents to english and then to target language as seen by the token predictions of the hidden layers.
- whats_llm_predicting_internally.ipynb -> Continuation of the is_llm_thinking_in_english.ipynb to check the top-k predicted tokens by hidden layers
- is_maths_also_language.ipynb -> Checking if translation has an effect on the reasoning abilities of the model. Trying out simple arithmetic in Devnagari numbers and checking what the internal state depicts.
